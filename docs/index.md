# Flask Operator

A Juju charm deploying and managing Flask on Kubernetes.
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a widely used micro web framework
written in Python. Please note, the Flask Operator is currently an experimental
project.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Flask on
Kubernetes, including scaling the number of instances, integration with charmed
databases, Canonical Observability Stack (COS) and more. It allows for
deployment on many different Kubernetes platforms, from
[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) to  [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes)
to public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
web application system whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the
freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Flask simple and
straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
enterprise deployments.
